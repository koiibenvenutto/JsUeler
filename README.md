# Koii's Project Euler Solutions using JS

Hello there! This repo is where I put my solutions to Project Euler problems. Some day my algorithm muscles will be big and strong but for now I'm just focusing on the little steps and trying not to get discouraged! Please leave whatever critiques or suggestions you like! :v:

Thank you to Jesse and Graham Rubin for helping me every step of the way. Please checkout their githubs here:
